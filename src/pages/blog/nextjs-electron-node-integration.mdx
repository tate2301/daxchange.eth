When developing a Next.js + Electron app, you might need to access the `fs` and `path`
modules. There are quite a number of things that won't work if you're unable to access
these, for example, saving a database file to the user's computer.

First things, modifying your `next.config.js` file to include the `fs` and `path` modules
will not work. This is because Next.js is a client-side framework and the `fs` and `path`
modules are only available in Node.js, in this case Electron Isolated Context. You just need
to enable `nodeIntegration` in your `BrowserWindow` options. Then you will provide the modules
you need through the `contextBridge` module.

Assuming you've already set up your Next.js + Electron app, here's how you can access
the `fs` and `path` modules. We will be using the recommended contextBridge from electron.

## Step 1: Create a preload.js file

```js
const win = new BrowserWindow({
  // ... other options
  webPreferences: {
    preload: path.join(__dirname, "preload.js"),
    nodeIntegration: true,
  },
});
```

## Step 2: Create a preload.js file

```js
// preload.js

const { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } = require("electron");

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("electron", {
  fs: window.require("fs"),
  path: window.require("path"),
});
```

## Step 3: Access the modules in your Next.js app

```js
// pages/index.js
useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    const fs = window.electron.fs;
    const path = window.electron.path;
    // ... do something with fs and path
  }
}, []);
```

We're using `typeof window !== "undefined"` to check if we're rendering client side.
This is because the `window` object is only available in the browser.

## Additional notes

You may want to create and export an electron API module to make it easier to access.
For example:

```js
// electron/api.js
const fs = window.electron.fs;
const path = window.electron.path;

const electronAPI = {
  fs,
  path,
};

export default electronAPI;
```

```js
// pages/index.js
import electronAPI from "../electron/api";

// ... other code

useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    const { fs, path } = electronAPI;
    // ... do something with fs and path
  }
}, []);
```

## Conclusion

I just wanted to share this because I had a hard time figuring this out. I hope this helps you!
