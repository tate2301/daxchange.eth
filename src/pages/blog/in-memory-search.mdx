More often than not, you find yourself looking for something online and can't seem to find. Naturally you reach out
to the handy search bar/box and type in some keywords, then boom, the thing shows up(or you get a "no results found").
But thats not the important part, the important part is how can you implement this in your own product without having to
sign up to yet another service.

> Search can dramatically increase the usability of your app and overall user experience.

## Building custom search with Flexsearch

Flexsearch is a next-generation full text search library for the browser and node.js, which seems to not be actively
maintained anymore(at the time of writing). Nonetheless it works pretty well, I didn't understand the latest documentation,
it seemed to not work with the latest release. So in this build we are going to use `flexsearch@0.7.2`, at least that seemed
to work for me.

### Getting started

I am going to assume you have already built your Node.js app, web-server or wherever you want to implement your search functionality.

```bash
yarn add flexsearch@0.7.2
```

Now time to import some stuff. There's a tonne of documentation about what the options do, you can read them [on their Github](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch)

```js
// Rest of your imports
const FlexSearch = require("flexsearch");

const searchIndex = FlexSearch.Index({
  preset: "memory",
  tokenize: "forward",
  resolution: 5,
});
```

Basically here is what we are going to do

- Build our index
- Define a key. Typically and ID field of our elements to index (allows us to support searching nested properties in objects)
- Define a content where we want to search.

### Building the index

Have in mind we are working with an in-memory search so be careful with the amount of data you load to the index. Also pay special attention to the key, its like our `PRIMARY_KEY`.

```js
const buildIndex = (items) => {
  items.map((item) => {
    const content = `${item.id} ${item.name} ${item.description} ${
      item.creator ? item.creator.username : item.author.username
    } ${item.display_name}`;
    const key = parseInt(item.id);
    searchIndex.add(key, content);
  });
};
```

### Building the search method

Okay, thats it. Now let's allow searching.

```js
const search = async (term) => {
  if (!term) return this.items.map((item) => item.id);
  const resultIds = await this.index.search({
    query: term,
    suggest: false, // When suggestion is enabled all results will be filled up (until limit, default 1000) with similar matches ordered by relevance.
  });

  return resultIds;
};
```

Remember when we talked about the key, the search method will return an array of the keys whose content matches the search term, it does
not return the entire object. Better have a method to get the data corresponding to the keys.

### Search for some stuff

```js
// Assuming its an express app
const route = (req, res) => {
  const { query } = req;
  const items = [
    // ...some stuff for you to search, probably from some db
  ];

  // Build the index
  buildIndex(items);

  return search(query).then((resultIds) => {
    const results = items.filter((item) => resultIds.includes(item.id));
    return res
      .status(200)
      .json({
        ...results,
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        return res.status(500).json({ error });
      });
  });
};
```

Well and thats it, we've built search. You can implement pagination after the getting the search results to create an even better experience.
